## 🧠 What’s Inside

Here’s a breakdown of the tasks and key takeaways from the internship:

### 🔍 **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Applied data cleaning techniques, handled missing values, and visualized patterns using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Generated meaningful insights from raw data, highlighting trends, outliers, and relationships.
- Learned the importance of **data storytelling**—translating numbers into narratives.

### 📊 **Task 2: Linear Regression Model**

- Implemented a **Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-Learn**.
- Evaluated model performance with metrics like **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Explored the impact of multicollinearity and feature selection.

### 🤖 **Task 3: Logistic Regression Model**

- Built a **Logistic Regression** classifier for binary classification tasks.
- Understood concepts like **decision boundaries** and **model interpretability**.
- Enhanced skills in **classification metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

### 🏗️ **Task 4: Machine Learning Pipeline**

- Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline combining preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Applied **train-test splitting**, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Emphasized the importance of a **structured workflow** for reproducible ML projects.
